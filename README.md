### 🧠 What is n8n?

**n8n** (short for *“nodemation”*) is a **powerful open-source workflow automation tool** that lets you connect different services and APIs — with or without code. It allows you to build **automated workflows** that handle data processing, API communication, and event-based triggers visually through an intuitive editor.

With n8n, you can:

* Automate repetitive tasks between multiple apps and APIs
* Create complex logic using conditionals, loops, and custom code nodes
* Integrate with hundreds of popular platforms like **Google Sheets**, **Facebook GraphQL**, **OpenAI/Gemini**, **Slack**, **Stripe**, and more
* Host it **locally** or deploy it on **cloud platforms** for full control and scalability

In this project, n8n acts as the **core workflow engine** that:

* Listens for incoming messages from Facebook Messenger
* Analyzes user input using AI
* Fetches product data from Google Sheets
* Sends the processed response back to Messenger through a webhook

This makes n8n the **central brain** that connects all AI and automation components together.
